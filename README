tinylog.sh
============

Low-footprint, low-brainprint logging & debugging library for Bash.

Just

    LOG='somefile'  # or LOG=`mktemp`
    source ./tinylog.sh

and any output (stdout & stderr) will be written to the logfile.  Use

    debug "A message.  Written to log and displayed when run interactively."
    error "Dito.  Will go to syslog in addition."
    warn "Same as error."

That's it.  If you want anything else, go fork yourself (a copy of this
repo)!
