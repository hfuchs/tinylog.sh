tinylog.sh
============
2011-09-13, HF

tinylog.sh tries to be a small logging & debugging library for Bash
(actually any POSIX-conforming shell [read dash]) that requires exceedingly
little mental effort to use in everyday scripting.  Being almost as minimal
as it can get away with, it is also well-nigh non-configurable.  So,

WARNING: Right now, this is very much proof-of-concept material!

Usage
-------

Just say

    . ${0%/*}/tinylog.sh       # or  `dirname $0`/tinylog.sh  :)

or even

    . tinylog.sh               # if tinylog's in your $PATH.

and any output (stdout & stderr) will be written to a log file in $TMPDIR.
If you want a permanent logfile, just say so:

    logfile="$(dirname $0)/my.log"   # or something like it.
    . ${0%/*}/tinylog.sh

Then, in your script, use

    debug    "A message.  Only displayed when run interactively."
    error    "Severe message.  Goes to syslog in addition to stdout and the log."
    warn     "Same as error, lower panic level."
    printlog # Dump log contents to stdout (not the redirected one).

On the other hand, you'll have to keep in mind that `echo`s will leave
traces only in the log file.  Except, of course, if you use

    echo "Hello" >&$stdout

That's it.  If you want anything else, go fork yourself (a copy of this
repo)!
