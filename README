tinylog.sh
============

tinylog.sh tries to be a small logging & debugging library for Bash that
requires exceedingly little mental effort to use in everyday scripting.
It uses Bashisms like IO redirection.

Just say

    logfile='my.log'     # or LOG=`mktemp`
    source ./tinylog.sh

and any output (stdout & stderr) will be written to the logfile.  Use

    debug "A message.  Written to log and displayed when run interactively."
    error "Dito.  Goes to syslog in addition."
    warn  "Same as error, lower panic level."

On the other hand, you'll have to keep in mind that `echo`s will leave
traces only in the log file.  Except, of course, if you use the highly
experimental

    echo "Hello" > $stdout

That's it.  If you want anything else, go fork yourself (a copy of this
repo)!


Further notice:

    you're into this sort of thing [and if so, don't - for the love of
    God! - ever contact me {except, of course, you know how I can
    GPL-protect my code without those ludicrous disclaimers
    everywhere}]).  See COPYING if you want a peek at the GPL.

  - I'll add a CREDITS and more flesh if anyone finds this helpful.
